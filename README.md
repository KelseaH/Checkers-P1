# Checkers-P1
The inspiration for creating this checkers game is because it's one of my favorite board games. Click and drag each piece in order to play. Pieces must move diagonally forward, toward the opponent's side of the board. The first player to capture all opposing checkers from the board wins the game. I used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create this project. Reguarding outstanding bugs and unfinished functionality; checker pieces move where they want despite direction or the space already being occupied and checker pieces don't disappear when they are supposed to be captured.
